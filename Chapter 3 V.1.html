<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<p>I opened my eyes, only to be greeted by an unsettling sight. I was in a place that looked like a bar, but that wasn’t what shocked me the most. What unnerved me was the way everyone was staring at me—eyes filled with disgust and fear.</p>

<p>I glanced down at my arm, only to find a smashed beer bottle gripped tightly in my right hand. What the hell...? I thought to myself, my mind racing to piece everything together.</p>

<p>I turned to face the broken bottle beside me, my reflection staring back at me.</p>

<p>Red hair. Brown eyes. Everything clicked in an instant.</p>

<p>I wasn’t just anyone. I had somehow possessed a character—a character named Lloyd Voltract, from the show The Dawn of Vergiland, the very same show I hated with a passion. The only reason I ever watched it was because Aaron had forced me to.</p>

<p>And now, here I was, in the body of Lloyd—a character universally despised. He was the oldest son of the Voltract family, hated by everyone, both within the world of the show and among the audience. Even Aaron hated him.</p>

<p>It wasn't hard to see why. Lloyd was a notorious jerk. He drank himself into oblivion every day and abused the servants in his family mansion. He’d earned every ounce of that hatred.</p>

<p>But it got worse. Lloyd wasn’t just a villain in the eyes of the world; his actions were what ultimately led to the tragedy in the show. The only reason I even knew this was because I had watched the series.</p>

<p>Lloyd, in a fit of rage, had been cast out from being heir to the Voltract family when his father, Noah Voltract, the head of the family and a count, made the wise decision to remove him. Of course, Lloyd didn’t take that well. In a reckless act of vengeance, he attacked the main character’s family for no reason at all. When the main character tried to stop him, he failed. The result? The main character’s family was killed, and that tragedy set the stage for everything that followed.</p>

<p>But what the world didn’t know, what only I knew, was that it was Lloyd who had set all of this in motion.</p>

<p>I couldn't fathom why I was now inside the body of such a vile character. As I stared at my reflection, still reeling from the reality of it all, I noticed a disturbance. A group of guards stormed into the bar, and it was obvious why—Lloyd wasn’t just hated for being a jerk, he was also one of the most talented mages in the Vergiland kingdom.</p>

<p>I stood up, preparing to face the guards, but something felt off. Normally, people would cower at the sight of Lloyd, but these guards... their eyes were not filled with fear. They looked at me with disdain.</p>

<p>Without warning, one of them lunged at me, spear raised. I barely had time to react before the cold steel pierced my stomach, right through the spot where the magic core is usually located.</p>

<p>The pain hit me like a shockwave, and I gasped. My body—Lloyd's body—was burning with the intensity of the wound.</p>

<p>But something else was happening. My vision blurred, and the guard who had stabbed me… he suddenly morphed into someone familiar.</p>
