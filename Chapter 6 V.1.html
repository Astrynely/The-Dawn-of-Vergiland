<h1>Chapter 6</h1>

<p>I had finally recovered. My body felt like it was waking from a long, heavy slumber, but as I lay there, staring blankly at the wall, something felt... different. There was a warmth in the air, subtle but undeniable, as if the atmosphere itself had come alive.</p>



<p>I blinked, focusing on the sensation. It flowed, like water, but fluctuated in a way I couldn’t explain. Complex yet oddly familiar, as if I could sense its rhythm and understand its dance. And then, amid the ebb and flow of this strange force, I saw them.</p>



<p>Two distinct components, like opposites—sugar and salt, heat and cold, hope and despair. They swirled around one another, like enemies locked in an eternal struggle, yet coexisting in perfect harmony.</p>



<p>The dots connected.</p>



<p>This sensation—this foreign energy—matched the descriptions of magic from The Dawn of Vergiland perfectly. But then it hit me: magic could not exist without a magic core, and my core had been destroyed, shattered into nothingness. If my core was truly gone, how was I sensing magic?</p>



<p>The question lingered in the air, unanswered, but something deep within me stirred—a familiar yet alien feeling, almost like a whisper. The magic...flowing into me, feeding into my core, and for a brief moment, I was filled with overwhelming realization.</p>



<p>My magic core... It isn’t gone.
Could it be? Had Wallace lied to me? He had said he shattered my magic core—frozen it beyond repair. But now, I felt warmth radiating from where my core should be, a subtle, undeniable warmth.</p>



<p>Three entities, not two, now circled within the core.
The first two were unmistakable: Hikaru—the light, and Kuro—the darkness, just as the stories had told. But the third? It was different. It wasn’t supposed to be there. It felt... unique, an anomaly in the balance.</p>



<p>The new entity wasn’t like the others. It radiated an energy I couldn’t place, something that felt both ancient and new, wild and controlled. It was... Aries. I wasn’t sure how I knew its name, but the connection was undeniable.</p>



<p>I pulled myself from the bed, feeling the weight of my thoughts pressing down on me. Slowly, I crossed my legs and sat in the center of the room, trying to steady my breathing. My heart raced as I closed my eyes and began to meditate, attempting to reach out and control the swirling entities within me.</p>



<p>I had to understand this power. I had to learn how to control them before they spiraled out of my reach .</p>



<p>As I meditated, focusing on the three entities, I felt them shift and respond to my presence. The light, Hikaru, pulsed warmly, almost encouraging me, while Kuro hummed with quiet intensity, as if urging caution. But Aries—the third entity—was different. It didn’t pulse or hum. Instead, it seemed to watch, its energy surging in unpredictable bursts.</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but wonder: What was Aries? I had never heard of it before. It was as if it had always been there, hidden beneath the surface of my magic, waiting for the right moment to emerge.</p>



<p>A sudden surge of power jolted through me. I gasped, my body trembling from the intensity. For a fleeting moment, it felt like the three entities were fighting—Hikaru and Kuro pulling in opposite directions, while Aries surged between them, trying to break free. I gritted my teeth, struggling to maintain control.</p>



<p>I had to stabilize them. I had to find a way to bring balance back before they tore me apart.
But then, something unexpected happened. The energy inside me began to calm, as if the entities had reached an unspoken agreement. They stopped fighting. Instead, they began to move together, flowing in a harmonious pattern.</p>



<p>The connection deepened.</p>



<p>I understood, in that moment, that Aries wasn’t an enemy. It wasn’t a mistake or an error. It was a new force—one that could bring balance to both light and darkness, something that had been missing from the world of magic for centuries.</p>


<p>

The question now was: What would I do with this power?</p>



<p>The next day, I began to search for answers.
I scoured the mansion's library, flipping through ancient texts and scrolls, but there was little to nothing about Aries. The more I read, the more I realized how little anyone knew about it. In the lore of Vergiland, magic had always been described as a balance between light and dark, the two components of magic circling the core. But Aries was never mentioned. It was like a hidden piece of a puzzle no one had ever found.</p>



<p>I needed to know more.</p>



<p>Perhaps Wallace knew something. He had been the one to claim my core was destroyed, after all. If he had lied to me about that, what else was he hiding?</p>



<p>I could feel it now, the power within me. It was stronger than it had ever been before, and I knew that there were forces—both friends and foes—that would soon come to understand just how dangerous this newfound magic could be.</p>



<p>But with Aries swirling within me, I felt something else, too: a sense of destiny. This power, this magic, was meant for something greater. I could feel it. And I would not stop until I uncovered the truth behind my core, the entities within it, and the destiny that awaited me</p>

.

<p>The balance of magic in Vergiland was shifting, and I would have to decide where I stood in that balance. But first, I needed to uncover the secrets that Wallace had kept hidden, and the answers I sought lay within him.</p>



<p>But still, as I made my way to the library as usual, I couldn’t shake the whispers that seemed to follow me. The mansion buzzed with rumors—rumors about me.
Some said I had changed after my humiliating defeat at the bar that night, as if the loss had somehow broken something within me. Others speculated darker things—that something was possessing my body, taking control of me from the inside.
I was stunned by the murmurs, but even more so when I realized with a sinking feeling that one of the rumors was true.
I had possessed Lloyd’s body. But it had been unintentional—completely unplanned. I hadn’t meant for any of this to happen. I hadn’t even chosen this body. A mysterious force had dragged me into this world and thrust me into a body that was not my own. I had no control over it at first, just a helpless bystander trapped within a strange shell.</p>



<p>Now, here I was, searching for the truth of the third entity circling my magic core—Aries—while struggling to understand my own fractured existence in this new world. Was I Lloyd? Or was I someone else entirely?
It didn’t matter. Not anymore. The truth of my magic, the mystery of Aries, was all that mattered now. Whatever had happened to me—whatever I had become—I had no choice but to press forward. The answers I sought were hidden deep within me, and the only way to find them was to face whatever this new reality had in store.</p>
