<h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<p>I was in the library, as usual, gathering information about this world when suddenly, a butler named Sebastian approached me.</p>



<p>"The Count summons you to his room, young master," he said.</p>



<p>With all the rumors circulating around the mansion, I had known this moment would come sooner or later. And now, here it was. I nodded, fully prepared for what lay ahead, and made my way to the Count's chamber.</p>



<p>I knocked on the door.
"I’ve arrived, Father," I called out as I opened it. Inside, I saw two figures standing before me. One was the Count, and the other was a lady who appeared to be around thirty years old. I dropped to one knee before the Count and spoke.
</p>


<p>"I, Lloyd, respond to your summons, Father. May I inquire as to the reason for my summons?"</p>



<p>The lady’s gaze met mine—sharp, piercing. Her eyes felt as though they were looking directly into my soul, and I couldn't help but break into a cold sweat. It wasn’t exhaustion or fear that caused it; it was the overwhelming aura emanating from both her and the Count. "Did they discover that I’m in Lloyd’s body?" I wondered in silence.</p>


<p>The lady whispered something to the Count. I couldn’t make out the words, but something in my gut told me it was something important. The Count’s face remained stoic as he listened, his expression unreadable.</p>



<p>After she finished speaking, the Count rose from his seat and gave me a sharp command.</p>



<p>"Stand, you’re dismissed."</p>



<p>His voice held an undeniable authority, and I obeyed immediately, bowing before retreating from the room.</p>



<p>As I stepped out into the hallway, I walked with purpose, unaware of the conversation unfolding behind me.</p>



<p>"Impossible. There’s no way someone could change so rapidly," the Count muttered.</p>


<p>"But I only detected one soul in his body," the lady replied.</p>


<p>"And I’m intrigued by the entities within his magic core."</p>


<p>"Explain yourself."</p>


<p>"There were three entities in his body. There should only be two entities circulating the magic core, but he’s an anomaly," the lady explained.</p>


<p>"What? Are you serious?" The Count's voice was filled with disbelief.</p>


<p>"I swear on my name—Esmeralda Kroft," she affirmed.</p>



<p>I was oblivious to this entire conversation, lost in my own thoughts as I continued down the hallway. Just as I turned the corner, I bumped into one of my younger siblings—or rather, Lloyd’s younger sibling. He looked at me with wide, confused eyes. I recognized him instantly. His name was Nolan Voltract, the second son of the Voltract family. From Lloyd's memories, I knew that Lloyd always found ways to pick on him.</p>



<p>Nolan stared at me, his confusion evident. I met his gaze blankly, feeling an odd sense of detachment. As I walked closer, his eyes widened, and he flinched, probably expecting me to strike him or curse him, just as Lloyd had done countless times before.</p>



<p>I wanted to apologize for all of Lloyd’s actions toward him, but the timing didn’t feel right, nor did the place. So, I kept the words to myself and simply walked past him.</p>



<p>When Nolan finally opened his eyes, he was stunned. He hadn't been hit, nor had I spoken any harsh words. Bewildered, he watched me as I casually strolled down the hallway, my hands in my pockets.
</p>


<p>Back in my room, I decided to spend my time as I always did—meditating. My goal was to gain control over magic. Yet, I still struggled. My magic core had been damaged by Wallace’s actions, and though I couldn’t blame him for it—after all, Lloyd had wronged him terribly—I still found myself in a difficult position. Wallace had exacted his revenge just after I’d been transported into Lloyd’s body, leaving me to deal with the aftermath.</p>



<p>After some time meditating, I finally felt the flow of magic through my fingertips. Though the essence of magic pulsed within me, I couldn’t quite grasp it fully. It felt intangible, like a fleeting presence, but with focus, I managed to condense the energy. It was like turning air into liquid, then solidifying it—an intricate process, but I succeeded. As the magic formed into a small orb of blue energy, I marveled at its beauty. The color reminded me of the ocean, a deep, inviting blue. But this was only the beginning, for only one entity—Hikaru, the 'light entity'—was involved.</p>



<p>I intended to materialize the 'dark entity,' Kuro, next, but I knew from the series that it was wiser to master one attribute at a time. Thus, I focused on Hikaru first, wanting to perfect my control over the light magic before moving on to the other entities.</p>



<p>Yet, my mind wandered back to Aries—the third entity in my core. Unlike Hikaru and Kuro, there was no mention of Aries in the series, and I had no clue where to begin searching for answers about it. What was Aries? And why did it appear in my magic core, unnoticed by everyone else?</p>



<p>I had no answers yet, but I was determined to find out.</p>



<p>The thought of Aries, the mysterious third entity within my magic core, gnawed at my thoughts. Hikaru and Kuro were familiar, their powers and nature well-documented in the lore I had studied. But Aries? It was as though I had stumbled upon something forbidden, something no one had ever spoken of, let alone understood. What was its purpose? Was it dangerous? And why was it tied to me?</p>



<p>Lost in thought, I reached my room and closed the door behind me. The solitude of my chamber was a welcome reprieve from the tension that seemed to follow me everywhere I went. I needed to meditate again—focus and center myself. It had become my routine, a means of finding some control over the chaos that had overtaken my life.</p>



<p>Sitting cross-legged in the center of the room, I closed my eyes and let the familiar sensation of magic begin to stir within me. It was a slow process, like waking from a long sleep. The energy of Hikaru surged first—gentle but powerful, like the first rays of dawn. I focused on it, letting the light magic flow through my body, through my fingers, and into the air before me.</p>



<p>The warmth of the magic was comforting, but as it expanded outward, something shifted. A coldness began to seep through the edges of my consciousness, a whisper of darkness that had no place in this moment. It was Kuro, his presence undeniable, but I could feel Aries—a third force—trying to push through. The pressure inside my core intensified.</p>



<p>I gasped as a wave of raw power surged through my body. It wasn’t painful, but it was overwhelming. My heart raced. I was still learning to control Hikaru, yet now I had to contend with this third entity. It felt... ancient. Unyielding.
Suddenly, a voice broke through my concentration.</p>



<p>"Lloyd?"</p>



<p>Startled, I opened my eyes to find Nolan standing in the doorway, looking hesitant. His expression was a mix of concern and confusion. "Are you... are you alright?"</p>



<p>For a moment, I didn't know how to respond. How could I explain what was happening inside of me? How could I tell him that I wasn’t the person he thought I was—that I was trapped in his brother's body, struggling to understand the strange forces within?
But I didn’t say any of that. Instead, I gave him a faint smile, hoping to mask the turmoil beneath the surface.
"I'm fine," I said, though I wasn’t sure I believed my own words.</p>



<p>Nolan took a few tentative steps into the room, his eyes scanning my expression. He seemed to be measuring something—whether it was my sincerity or my mental state, I couldn’t tell. "You seem... different," he said quietly, his gaze flicking to the floor, then back to me. "I don’t know how to explain it, but... you’re not acting like Lloyd."</p>



<p>I froze. His words cut deeper than I expected. Was it that obvious? Had the change in behavior been so stark that even Nolan, who had been treated horribly by Lloyd, could see it?</p>



<p>I cleared my throat, trying to regain my composure. "I’m just... trying to adjust, that’s all."
There was a long pause before Nolan spoke again, his voice softer now. "Look, I don’t know what’s going on, but if you need help... if you need someone to talk to, you don’t have to do this alone."
</p>


<p>The sincerity in his offer surprised me. I had expected hostility or fear—after all, the Lloyd in his memories wasn’t exactly the kind of person who inspired trust. But this was different. Nolan was offering an olive branch, unsure of how to extend it, but willing nonetheless.</p>



<p>I nodded slowly, grateful for his kindness, though I still couldn’t fully grasp what this new dynamic meant. "Thank you, Nolan. I... I’ll keep that in mind."</p>



<p>He gave me a small, uncertain smile before turning and leaving the room, leaving me alone with my thoughts once again. But now, there was a new layer to my confusion—a curiosity about how this version of Lloyd, this version of me, would affect the relationships around me.</p>



<p>What would the Count think?  And what was Aries, really?
As I sat back down, trying to regain control of my magic, a new sense of urgency settled in. I couldn’t keep ignoring the truth, not when there were forces at play that I barely understood. If I didn’t figure out what Aries was, it might just take over everything—and everyone—in my life.</p>
