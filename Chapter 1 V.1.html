  <h1 align="center">Chapter 1</h1>

<p align="center">My mother was killed in front of my eyes.My mother's blood splashed on my cheeks, as I watch the scene with a terrified face.</p>

<p align="center">I says to the person beside me and I told him that this show is not my favourite at all. He responded by saying "Why not, this show is really interesting .it's</p>
<p>even my favourite show" .While making a mocking face.</p>

<p align="center">After the show ended, I said to the person beside me which is my only friend, Aaron that I will never watch a show like this again.
He smirked.</p>
<p align="center">After that he suddenly asked me an unexpected question with a confident tone.</p>

<p align="center">"If you're the main character in that show, would you save everyone?"</p>

<p align="center">I hesitated for a moment .I can't answer it .Not because I don't want to save everyone, but the overwhelming physical and mental pain that the main character has faced is just unimaginable, with his whole family killed by their enemies .His father and brother were assassinated, his little sister was captured and then taking a suicide and at last his mother was brutally killed in front of his eyes.</p>

<p align="center">"He can't even save his own family, so how am I even supposed to save everyone?".</p>

<p align="center">I said, and I added "Even if I were to posses his body, I still can't do anything because he is powerless in a world filled with magic and chivalry".</p>

<p align="center">"How can you be that confident when you haven't even finished watching the show yet?".Said Aaron</p>

<p align="center">"Well, the show haven't even ended yet".I responded.</p>

<p align="center">He giggled.</p>

<p align="center">Just before I was going to asked him why did he giggled, a loud shout was heard from my back.</p>

<p align="center">"AAAAKKKKHHH!!!"</p>

<p align="center">The shout was loud and terrifying .As I turn my head, I saw something that were never meant to be seen .A chill run down to my body and I asked Aaron with a trembling voice</p>

<p align="center">"….is that…a m-monster?"</p>

<p align="center">A 2 metres creature is devouring a man .It has 6 limbs, 3 eyes and a red horn resting on it's head .The monster turn it head and stared at me as if it is looking at a fragile prey.</p>

<p align="center">The crowd scrambled and run with all their might .I want to run but the death stare I'm receiving keep me unable to move a muscle due to fear .The monster slowly approaches to me .With its sharp and long claws it tried to attack me but I was saved by Aaron, he then grabbed my arm and dragged me to the exit.
He shout out loud,</p>

<p align="center">"Are you crazy! Why won't you move a muscle when that monster approached you?!"</p>

<p align="center">I was so scared to a point that there were no words coming out of my mouth .My friend suggested that we should get out from the building .But it seems that my leg is not responding to my directions .</p>
Suddenly, Aaron dragged me into a corner and ask me with a strict tone</p>

<p align="center">"Will you move your a$$....or die here"</p>

<p align="center">I finally recovered from my fear .After that, we ran towards the exit out of the building.
But the outside is a lot more dangerous than inside .There were countless monster devouring civilians, animals and even some police officers .
Aaron made a quick and wise decision by entering back to the cinema.</p>

<p align="center">Unfortunately, we met with the previous monster down the hall way .We run away from the monster but we were met with a dead end .Right before the monster attack us, there was a sudden earthquake that shook the whole building .While the monster was distracted, Aaron take the chance and grabbed a fire extinguisher from a nearby wall and throw it towards the monster's head .The fire extinguisher hit the monster's red horn .Turns out, the red horn was actually the monster's weakness .The monster died instantly from the blow .
