<h1>Chapter 5</h1>


<p>The spear vanished in an instant, leaving nothing but the sharp echo of its disappearance. Wallace, his expression as cold as ice, turned and began to walk away. As he passed the broken form of Lloyd, still kneeling in agony, he spoke over his shoulder, his voice dripping with contempt.</p>


<p>“I hope you don’t hold a grudge against me,” Wallace’s words sliced through the air. “I’m only executing my vengeance.”</p>


<p>Lloyd’s bloodshot eyes locked onto Wallace, his body trembling, not from the pain of his injuries, but from the searing hate that burned inside him. He tried to speak, to curse, to shout. But the words refused to form. Before he could even take a breath, the world around him went black.</p>


<p>When Lloyd finally awoke, the first thing he felt was confusion. He was no longer in the bar. No longer on the cold, stone floor. He was in a room, foreign and alien to him. The walls were pristine, the furniture lavish. But none of that mattered when a crushing pain suddenly tore through his chest, right where his magic core should have been.</p>


<p>It felt as though his very soul was being pulled apart.</p>


<p>Lloyd gasped, his hands instinctively clutching his stomach, desperate to stop the agony. His breath came in ragged gasps as he writhed on the bed, the pain twisting and contorting his insides. It felt as if he were being consumed by the darkness itself.</p>


<p>The agony lasted for what seemed like an eternity. His body trembled violently, yet no tears came. Lloyd hadn’t cried in years, not since the world had turned its back on him. Finally, as if some invisible force relented, the pain began to subside, leaving only a hollow emptiness behind. But it was too much. Too confusing. He didn’t understand what had happened. He didn’t understand anything anymore.</p>


<p>The door creaked open.</p>

<p>A maid entered, her brown hair tied neatly in a braid, pushing a trolley filled with food. Her eyes flickered toward Lloyd, then quickly averted, as if she feared his gaze. Her lips were set in a hard line, but Lloyd could see the subtle tremor in her hands.</p>


<p>Without a word, she placed the plate of food before him, her gaze lingering for a moment too long.</p>


<p>“Thank you,” Lloyd said, the words slipping out before he could stop them. His voice was hoarse, almost foreign to him, and he could hardly recognize it. He had never once been polite to a servant. He had never cared.</p>


<p>The maid paused, staring at him for a heartbeat too long, before giving a curt nod and turning to leave. As the door clicked shut behind her, her mind was racing.</p>


<p>Did he really change?</p>

<p>She had served him long enough to know that his heart was made of stone. He had been cruel, callous, and indifferent to everyone, even his own family. But this? This wasn’t like him. Not even close. The way he had spoken... it was as if a different person had taken his place.
She couldn't help but wonder. Had that accident changed him?</p>


<p>But just as quickly as the thought had come, she pushed it away, too unsettled to dwell on it. Her role was clear. She had no room for curiosity. She was a maid, and she had duties to attend to.</p>


<p>Lloyd stared at the plate, his mind spinning. The food before him was luxurious—far beyond anything he could have ever imagined in his former life. He picked up a piece, almost instinctively, and shoved it into his mouth. The flavors exploded on his tongue, rich and complex, unlike anything he had ever tasted before.</p>


<p>He chewed slowly, savoring the exquisite taste. But then the thought hit him, hard, like a slap to the face.</p>

<p>
Wallace destroyed my magic core.</p>

<p>He froze. For a brief moment, it felt as if time itself had come to a standstill.</p>


<p>In the world of The Dawn of Vergiland, there was no hope for someone without a magic core. No hope for anyone whose core had been shattered. Without magic, he was nothing. The very essence of his being, the thing that had defined him, was gone.
Lloyd’s entire existence had been built on the power he drew from his magic. Without it, he was nothing. He couldn’t fight. He couldn’t defend himself. He was a broken, useless shell in a world where only the strong survived.</p>


<p>The realization was suffocating. His future, once filled with boundless potential, now lay in ruin. Wallace had taken everything from him. And for what? Vengeance. He had ruined Lloyd’s life for a revenge.</p>


<p>But just as the weight of despair began to crush him, something inside him snapped. A strange dizziness washed over him. His vision blurred and darkened, and for a brief moment, he felt as if he were floating.</p>


<p>No, not again...</p>

<p>He felt himself drifting in a void, weightless, surrounded by an impenetrable darkness. And yet, despite the absence of light, he could see.</p>


<p>Not his body. But his old body—the one that had been his before all of this. The body he had lost in the transfer to Lloyd’s form. It was falling. A long, endless descent into nothingness. His eyes were closed, his expression frozen in a mask of regret.</p>


<p>And then, as though the floodgates had opened, memories surged through him like an avalanche. They were his, but not his. The other Lloyd’s memories, his past sins, his cruelties. Every horrible act, every brutal choice, flashed before his eyes.</p>


<p>He saw it all—the endless suffering he had inflicted on others, the destruction, the lies. But one memory stood out more than the rest.</p>


<p>The memory of Nelly, Wallace younger sister .</p>

<p>
Lloyd had offered her an impossible choice—become his partner, and her family would be spared. Or refuse, and watch them die. Nelly, proud and untouchable, had chosen her pride over her family. In the end, she chose death over submission. Her own life, her own pride, had been more important than everything else.</p>


<p>The memory hit Lloyd like a freight train. The weight of it crushed him.
Amidst all the darkness of these new memories, one small glimmer of something unexpected flickered. There, buried deep within the wreckage of his soul, was a strange and unfamiliar knowledge.</p>


<p>The basics of magic.</p>


<p>It was as though the memories themselves had gifted him this forgotten knowledge. Not just the power to wield magic, but the very essence of it. It was his last chance. A fleeting hope in a world filled with darkness.</p>


<p>And for the first time in years, Lloyd felt something stir deep within him—a spark.</p>
