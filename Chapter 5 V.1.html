<h1>Chapter 5</h1>


<p>The spear vanished in an instant, leaving nothing but the sharp echo of its disappearance. Wallace, his expression as cold as ice, turned and began to walk away. As he passed the broken form of Lloyd, still kneeling in agony, he spoke over my shoulder, his voice dripping with contempt.</p>


<p>“I hope you don’t hold a grudge against me,” Wallace’s words sliced through the air. “I’m only executing my vengeance.”</p>


<p>Lloyd’s bloodshot eyes locked onto Wallace, my body trembling, not from the pain of his injuries, but from the searing hate that burned inside him. I tried to speak, to curse, to shout. But the words refused to form. Before I could even take a breath, the world around me went black.</p>


<p>When I finally awoke, the first thing I felt was confusion. I was no longer in the bar. No longer on the cold, stone floor. I was in a room, foreign and alien to me. The walls were pristine, the furniture lavish. But none of that mattered when a crushing pain suddenly tore through my chest, right where my magic core should have been.</p>


<p>It felt as though my very soul was being pulled apart.</p>


<p>I gasped, my hands instinctively clutching my stomach, desperate to stop the agony. My breath came in ragged gasps as I writhed on the bed, the pain twisting and contorting my insides. It felt as if I were being consumed by the darkness itself.</p>


<p>The agony lasted for what seemed like an eternity. My body trembled violently, yet no tears came. I hadn’t cried in years, not since the world had turned its back on me. Finally, as if some invisible force relented, the pain began to subside, leaving only a hollow emptiness behind. But it was too much. Too confusing. I didn’t understand what had happened. I didn’t understand anything anymore.</p>


<p>The door creaked open.</p>

<p>A maid entered, her brown hair tied neatly in a braid, pushing a trolley filled with food. Her eyes flickered toward me, then quickly averted, as if she feared my gaze. Her lips were set in a hard line, but I could see the subtle tremor in her hands.</p>


<p>Without a word, she placed the plate of food before me, her gaze lingering for a moment too long.</p>


<p>“Thank you,” I said .</p>


<p>The maid paused, staring at me for a heartbeat too long, before giving a curt nod and turning to leave. As the door clicked shut behind her, her mind was racing.</p>


<p>Did he really change?</p>

<p>She had served him long enough to know that his heart was made of stone. He had been cruel, callous, and indifferent to everyone, even his own family. But this? This wasn’t like him. Not even close. The way he had spoken... it was as if a different person had taken his place.
She couldn't help but wonder. Had that accident changed him?</p>


<p>But just as quickly as the thought had come, she pushed it away, too unsettled to dwell on it. Her role was clear. She had no room for curiosity. She was a maid, and she had duties to attend to.</p>


<p>I stared at the plate, my mind spinning. The food before me was luxurious—far beyond anything I could have ever imagined in my former life. I picked up a piece, almost instinctively, and shoved it into my mouth. The flavors exploded on my tongue, rich and complex, unlike anything I had ever tasted before.</p>


<p>I chewed slowly, savoring the exquisite taste. But then the thought hit me, hard, like a slap to the face.</p>

<p>
Wallace destroyed my magic core.</p>

<p>I froze. For a brief moment, it felt as if time itself had come to a standstill.</p>


<p>In the world of The Dawn of Vergiland, there was no hope for someone without a magic core. No hope for anyone whose core had been shattered. Without magic, he was nothing. The very essence of his being, the thing that had defined Lloyd, was gone.
Lloyd’s entire existence had been built on the power he drew from his magic. Without it, he was nothing. He couldn’t fight. He couldn’t defend himself. He was a broken, useless shell in a world where only the strong survived.</p>


<p>The realization was suffocating. His future, once filled with boundless potential, now lay in ruin. Wallace had taken everything from him. And for what? Vengeance. He had ruined Lloyd’s life for a revenge.</p>


<p>But just as the weight of despair began to crush me, something inside me snapped. A strange dizziness washed over my mind. My vision blurred and darkened, and for a brief moment, I felt as if I were floating.</p>


<p>No, not again...</p>

<p>I felt himself drifting in a void, weightless, surrounded by an impenetrable darkness. And yet, despite the absence of light, I could see.</p>


<p>Not Lloyd's body. But my old body—the one that had been mine before all of this. The body I had lost in the transfer to Lloyd’s form. It was falling. A long, endless descent into nothingness. His eyes were closed, his expression frozen in a mask of regret.</p>


<p>And then, as though the floodgates had opened, memories surged through me like an avalanche. They were mine, but not mine. The other Lloyd’s memories, his past sins, his cruelties. Every horrible act, every brutal choice, flashed before my eyes.</p>


<p>I saw it all—the endless suffering he had inflicted on others, the destruction, the lies. But one memory stood out more than the rest.</p>


<p>The memory of Nelly, Wallace younger sister .</p>

<p>
Lloyd had offered her an impossible choice—become his partner, and her family would be spared. Or refuse, and watch them die. Nelly, proud and untouchable, had chosen her pride over her family. In the end, she chose death over submission. Her own life, her own pride, had been more important than everything else.</p>


<p>The memory hit me like a freight train. The weight of it crushed me.
Amidst all the darkness of these new memories, one small glimmer of something unexpected flickered. There, buried deep within the wreckage of his soul, was a strange and unfamiliar knowledge.</p>


<p>The basics of magic.</p>


<p>It was as though the memories themselves had gifted me this forgotten knowledge. Not just the power to wield magic, but the very essence of it. It was my  last chance. A fleeting hope in a world filled with darkness.</p>


<p>And for the first time in years, I felt something stir deep within me—a spark.</p>
