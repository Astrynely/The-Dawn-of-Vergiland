<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<p>Aaron and I sighed out of relief .I've never expect Aaron could pull that move .</p>

<p>But he did it .</p>

<p>The earthquake happens again .Aaron suggest going outside since the cinema was about to collapse ."Fine with me" I said .</p>

<p>When we're outside, we were shocked and scared because turns out, the cause of the earthquake is a giant cyclops towering the nearby buildings .</p>


<p>I questioned myself in my thought "I-Is this really the end of humanity..?"</p>


<p>In the midst of terror, I suddenly heard something .The tone is so angelic I even thought an angel was speaking to me .</p>

<p>I'm panicked as my vision went dark .All of my senses went numb and I couldn't see, hear or feel anything .My mind went serene .I feel like I can do anything in that state .</p>

<p>I heard something again .As my senses recovering, I saw a child with white hair wearing a white cloth .His face and expression is like an angel, so pure and kind .</p>


<p>"Are you lost mister?" asked the child .</p>


<p>I looked at him while smiling and says yes .He stared at me and proceed to smile .His smile was as bright as the sun itself, maybe even brighter .</p>


<p>"Where are we?" I asked .</p>


<p>He hesitated for a moment and nods .He tried to says something but I couldn't hear anything as if something is disrupting our conversation .</p>


<p>Suddenly, a woman with a white hair in dress appear out of no where .She looked at me and ask if I am Aaron .
With a confused face, I answered her with a no .</p>


<p>She's shocked, I can judge by her face that Aaron was supposed to be here and not me .</p>


<p>The situations became awkward .Right before wanted to ask the woman where am I, the woman suddenly speak in a language that I can't understand, but I feel like she's casting something instead of speaking .</p>


<p>A glowing circle suddenly appear in front of her and  there are a few words that I can't decipher circling the glowing circle .</p>


<p>Suddenly, my body feels hot like a furnace burning inside my body .I clenched my chest and proceed to fall on the ground .The pain that I'm receiving is incomparable to the pain that I've received my whole life, not even close .</p>


<p>My body went unconscious as a respond .</p>
