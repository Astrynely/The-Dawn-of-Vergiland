<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<p>Aaron and I let out a sigh of relief. I never expected him to pull that off, but somehow, he did.
Then, the earthquake struck again. "We need to get out," Aaron suggested urgently, as the cinema groaned under the pressure. "It's about to collapse."</p>


<p>"Fine with me," I said, my heart racing.</p>


<p>Outside, we were greeted by an unimaginable sight. The cause of the quake was clear: a giant cyclops, towering over the nearby buildings, shaking the earth beneath us.</p>

<p>I couldn't help but think, Is this really the end of humanity...?</p>


<p>In the midst of the chaos, a voice pierced through the fear. The tone was so pure, so angelic, I thought for a second it was an angel speaking to me.</p>


<p>Before I could process it, my vision blurred, and everything went dark. My senses vanished, as though the world had muted itself. The calmness that washed over me was unlike anything I’d ever felt. It was almost as if, in this strange state, I could do anything.</p>


<p>Then, a sound—faint but clear—reached me again. Slowly, my senses returned. As my vision cleared, I saw a child with white hair, wearing simple white clothing. His face held an innocence so pure, I almost didn’t want to believe he was real.</p>


<p>"Are you lost, mister?" the child asked, his voice gentle and comforting.
I smiled and nodded. "Yes," I said softly.</p>


<p>He stared at me for a moment, then smiled back. His smile was blinding, brighter than the sun itself.</p>


<p>"Where are we?" I asked, the confusion evident in my voice.
The child hesitated, his eyes searching for the right words. He nodded, then tried to speak, but the words were drowned out, like a whisper lost in the wind.</p>


<p>Just as I was about to ask again, a woman appeared beside us. She, too, had white hair, and her dress seemed to shimmer in the dim light. She looked at me and asked, "Are you Aaron?"
Confused, I shook my head. "No."</p>


<p>Her face fell, and I could tell by the way her expression shifted that she had been expecting someone else—someone named Aaron. The tension in the air became palpable.</p>

<p>Before I could ask where I was or what was happening, the woman suddenly spoke in a language I didn’t understand. It wasn’t just words—it felt like she was casting something, the air itself seemed to vibrate with her voice.</p>


<p>A glowing circle materialized in front of her, the words circling it, shifting and twisting in a language beyond comprehension.</p>


<p>Then, the pain came. It burned inside me like a furnace, searing through every fiber of my being. My chest tightened, and I gasped, clutching at it. The agony was unlike anything I had ever known—deeper than any physical wound, it felt as though my very soul was being torn apart.</p>

<p>I collapsed to the ground, unable to keep my eyes open. The pain was unbearable, and I blacked out.</p>
