<h1>Chapter 4</h1>


<p>As the pain from the spear’s thrust spread through my body, I could barely focus on the figure standing above me. My vision blurred, but something about the person who had attacked me felt... off. There was a presence, an intensity in their gaze that struck a familiar chord deep within me.</p>


<p>The guard, who had morphed into someone I knew all too well, lifted his helm. His features became clearer, and then, it hit me like a freight train. It was him. The main character of The Dawn of Vergiland—the one whose family had been killed because of my actions.</p>

<p>His name was... Wallace.</p>


<p>Wallace stood there, his eyes filled with a raw, unrelenting hatred. For a moment, I felt like I was staring into the very soul of the person whose entire world had been destroyed because of my reckless vengeance. The very person whose pain I had never truly understood until now.</p>


<p>"You..." I whispered, breath labored. "You're... Wallace."</p>


<p>Wallace’s face twisted, a mix of sorrow and anger. "You remember me now, do you?" His voice was cold, yet I could hear the undercurrent of rage bubbling just beneath the surface. "Do you know what you did to my family, to everything I loved?"</p>


<p>His words stabbed into me like a thousand needles, each one reminding me of the destructive chain of events I had caused.</p>


<p>I wanted to speak, to apologize, to explain the twisted circumstances that led to my actions. But the words caught in my throat, drowned by the overwhelming pain that surged through me. The spear was still lodged in my stomach, and my magic core, where my mana was most dense, felt as though it was being siphoned away by the wound.</p>


<p>Wallace took a step closer, his hands trembling with barely contained fury. "I was a child. I couldn’t protect them. I couldn’t save my family... because of you." His voice broke, the mask of composure slipping for just a moment.</p>


<p>Wallace’s entire life was shattered because of Lloyd’s actions, and now, instead of simply ending Lloyd’s life, Wallace wants him to understand and experience the devastation he caused. He wants Lloyd to suffer the same way Wallace has suffered—losing everything that mattered to him, including the most important part of who he is: his magic.</p>

<p>In that moment, Wallace's desire for vengeance shifts from a simple death to a more profound punishment. By destroying Lloyd's magic core, Wallace is stripping away the very thing that made him special. Losing the ability to wield magic is far worse than death for someone like Lloyd, especially with his exceptional magical talent.</p>
